<em>Example of a mens cut</em></p>

<p>Article:</p>

<p>Mens cuts are one of my favourite things to do. People assume they&#39;re easiest because generally they are the quickest to do. Mens cuts are short so they have to be precise and spot on or else you see mistakes.</p>

<p>Right now we&#39;re starting to see men with more colour in their hair, hair tattoos and cuts with feminine aspects.</p>

<p>To the right is a good example of a modern mens style. WE have the short cropped sides, and clean around the ear and neckline. But we have that wave of length on top complete with a coloured streak. It&#39;s true most men keep their hair cropped whenever possible as it&#39;s easier and &quot;more masculine&quot; but there is a rise in edgier styles emerging into the public.</p>

<p>Generally as long as the cut works with your personality and style, is appropriate for work in terms of length and colour, then anything goes!</p>

<p>THe top five mens cuts I do at work would have to be:
- Regular cesar cut. (shaved sides and back with a flick at the front)
- Buzz cut or fade.
- Faux-Hawk.
- Hockey shag.
- Side-part gelled to the side look.</p>

<p>Mens cuts are one of my favourite things to do in the salon! If you have any questions, email me here (with a photo if needed.)</p>
