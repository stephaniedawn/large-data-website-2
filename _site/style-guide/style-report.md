# Style-Tile One

##Pros
	- Soft colours make it seem appealing to both male and female audiences. By staying away from a bubblegum type pink it remains neutral gender-based.
	- The graphic bobbypins could be fun to play around with and used as underlines or to emphasis important information.
	- It's very clean and fresh so it wouldn't get cluttered too easily.

##Cons
	- Not too sure if it reads "hairstyling blog" or whether it screams more magazine layout.
	- Not sure if the colours are too feminine or just right.
	- I feel as though maybe there's no great contrast between colours and white space and that the entire webpage may just be overlooked as boring.
	
# Style-Tile Two

##Pros
	- The colours would surely catch your attention.
	The cubes are a very exciting way to create emphasis or to lead your eye around the page as wanted.
	I enjoy the header font as it really describes the blogs name and shows it off well.

##Cons
	- I wonder if it will be too feminine.
	- Too narrow of an age-group in terms of design and colour.
	- Too immature looking? (Hm, but it is a personal 	blogâ€¦)
	
# Style-Tile Three

##Pros
	- Very gender-neutral.
	- Suitable for all age groups.
	- Very clean and fresh and not an eye-sore!

##Cons
	- It's fairly plain and doesn't really describe my personal style well.
	- It almost looks too "newspaper-y"
