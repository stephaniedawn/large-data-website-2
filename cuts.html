	<h2 class="trending-now">Angled Bob:</h2>
			<p class="figcaption"><i>September 25th, 2013</i></p>
			
			<div class="blog-1">
				<p class="blog-1-p">Ahhh, the <b>angled bob.</b></p>
				<p class="blog-1-p">This cut will forever be popular. Victoria Beckham surely made it the popular first with her sleek platinum locks.</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p">This haircut is great on most face shapes. You can always change the angle or length to suit the person better.<br>The beauty of this cut is how the back is cropped so short, you don't even have to style it.<br>Unless you're one of the unfortunate few who have crazy bed head in the mornings. Either way, nothing a little water can't fix.<br>It's just a stylish, feminine cut that's great for on-the-go women.<br>Countless times I've give some variation of the angled bob to a new mother, or mom-to-be.</p>

	<h2 class=" trending-now trending-now-2">Half-shaved Head:</h2>
			<p class="figcaption"><i>August 20th, 2013</i></p>
			
			<div class="blog-1">
				<p class="blog-1-p">This has always been a curious look to me.</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p">I remember years ago being in highschool and seeing a girl walk past me. I did a double take. The first time I had seen the half-head shave with long hair.</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p">I'll admit, on her, it was stunning.<br>It's a daring look, very edgy, especially when you have <i>long</i> hair.<br>If you have the guts, I say go for it.<br>The only issue is: the grow out faze. Be aware that if you grow tired of the looking, growing it out will look ridiculous for awhile.<br>I also suggest you have medium-to-thick hair if you're looking into doing it. (It will help the grow-out stage, and overally look better. If you're hair is too fine, it could look like you're just losing your hair. To be brutally honest.<br>Famous male example: Sonny Moore of Skrillex.</p>
