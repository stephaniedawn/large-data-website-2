				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">What's in right now? Being weird. And obviously that means playing it up just as weird with your hair.</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">I remember when I was 15, I dyed my hair blue-black for the first time ever.<br>I loved it; being the weird kid. But it also gave off the impression that you enjoyed doing your own thing, and keeping to yourself.<br>Well, not anymore. It's now forgiveable to stand out a bit too much. Pastels are all the rage. And, oh? Your roots are showing? That's alright. A lot of hairshoots show models with their roots grown out.<br>I guess it's all part of this grunge-edgy-hipster faze we're going through.<br>Don't get me wrong though, I adore it. Who doesn't like pink, blue, purple, or yellow?</p>

				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">What was once made fun of, is actually, quite popular now.</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">Yes, it's still hard to be a natural red head. There's always going to be those silly bullies out there making fun of you for your natural hair colour. But you have the rarest of hair colours, so why the heck should you take it personally. Be proud! It will is beautiful.<br>It just so happens to be all the rage to dye your hair red, so why mock the beauties who have it naturally?<br>One of my friends just dyed her hair a 'BAM!' red and I'm really proud. Normally her look is very natural blonde. Hair is hair, why not have some fun with it!</p>

				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">The lazy way to stunning highlights.</b></p>
				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">Nah, I'm just kidding about the lazy thing. But seriously? It's great for those of you who can't always get a root touch-up done every 6 weeks! It's like a beautiful version of the 90s "dyed tips".</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">Almost every celebrity has tried it. It can be pulled off on any length of hair, it's super easy to maintain and you can use a variety of colours, and ombre it very subtle or quite a few levels lighter than your natural colour if you really want it to pop.<br>I'm actually looking into doing this look on myself. As a girl who's been platinum blonde for over a year, it's just getting tedious trying to sneak in hair appointments between class and project time.<br>Not to mention it kills my hair. I think it's a beautiful, easy and alternative route to going lighter or wanting highlights. I can easily see why it's all the rage!</p>
