				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">What exactly does "professional only" mean?</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">Whether it's online or from Walmart, many professional hair care brands have gone public.<br>There are a few exceptions of course, but generally you can find Matrix, TIGI, and Crew anywhere you go now.<br>Then to compete with our industry, we have brands such as L'Oreal and Tresemme that are quite top notch and up-and-coming with their technology. So much so that it is hard as a stylist to sell retail.</p>

				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">With a hair product.</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">All you fine-haired chicks out there, meet the teasing powder. It's available from plenty of brands out there. You may have even seen it before but just didn't know what it was or how to use it. But listen to me: it does wonders!<br>Basically I use it on my roots before teasing to get extra body and volume from my otherwise limp, dull, and depressingly lifeless hair.<br>It has a strange cooling and tingling sensation much like talc or Goldbond powder, and adds some grittiness. I wouldn't use it everyday as it would eb a product that produces a lot of dirty build-up. But for up-dos or a night out where you want some OOPMH! in your hair, I say go for it.<br>Keep in mind as well that it's white, so rub it into your roots/scalp if you're dark-haired.</p>

				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">This isn't even a professional-only line, but I love it.</p>
				<p class="blog-1-p cblog-1-p imgbox-text">First off, the smell is Godly. Just pure amazing. Secondly, the texture is great, and easily manipulated between your hands or fingers.<br>When my hair was shorter (picture an angled graduated bob) I used this stuff and it always gave me the cutest flip at the back. Doesn't look greasy, clumped, or sticky. And doesn't really feel that way either as long as you don't go overboard with the stuff.<br>I think over the years they've tweaked the packaging, but you can still find it in your local drugstores and the like.</p>
