## Observations

- Did the participants have any common comments?

Both participants felt as though some of my Titles could also be categories so there was confusion with a few of the cards.

- Did they have questions that stood out?

Some common questions were: a) What is a perm and relaxer? and b) What do you mean by "tools of the trade"?

- Did they struggle with certain articles or topics?

Hairstyling isn't an overly complicated topic so overall they both came up with similar categories with little struggle.

- Did they find common groupings? Or were the groupings completely different?

They were similar, Lisa had three categories and Mansura, two. Just Lisa lumped two of Mansura's categories together.

- Were some of the groupings completely unexpected?

I wasn't overly surprised by the way they categorized my topic. 

- Were the results similar to your expectations?

I was thinking the results would be much how they ended up being. I only changed one category.

- How did you feel while watching them perform the task?

I felt they did a good job, and I felt completely certain they would help me categorize my topic; therefore I was very relaxed.
