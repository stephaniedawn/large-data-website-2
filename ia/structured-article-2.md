Ah, bangs. You love them then hate them, then love them again. They're constantly in and out of style, constantly needing trims, but constantly enhancing features on women since— well, who knows when. But seriously, bangs can do wonders to accentuate face shapes and hide flaws and the like. 

It all starts with face shape when determining whether or not bangs are right for you. The image on the right shows a girl with a very high forhead and fairly fine hair. The reason why these bangs work so well for her are because it closes in the top half of the face, taking the emphasis away from the large forehead, the sidesweep makes it less of a commitment as you can let them grow out quite a bit without going nuts and it's a more laidback look, (unlike straight across bangs) and the area they were taken from (far back) makes them appear fuller. This look would not work for someone with a naturally very small forhead it would only close in their face and features further.

Normally smaller forheads it is suggested the hair be pulled back, therefor no bangs at all would be the better option to open up the face more.

If you have a very oblong, round, or heart shape face bangs are very suitable but of course can be managed in all face shapes.

Bangs that taper down the sides of the face can slim a very round face. Whispy bangs can soften up any harsh angles to a face. Straight across blunt bangs are very old yet always seen as portraying modern, edgy women. That or very old out of fashion women. It all depends. Personalities and style comes into play as well when you're choosing your hair cut; specifically bangs. Ask your stylist what bangs and options would work best for you!
