For the free spirited guy or gal out there, there is the option of unnatural pigmented dyes to get your hair looking like Yugioh or Sailor Mercury. Funky colours can be fun for everyone. As the colour molecule in unnatural pigmented dyes are very large, they do not last very long. This means, the molecule cannot sit within the hair cuticle layer (layer that holds pigment and keratin and a bunch of other things that structure the hair itself) and therefore after a few hair washe the colour "bleeds" or fades.

Funky colours range from very saturated to muted, very bright and solid, to faded and just slightly tinted. It all depends on how light your hair is prelightened to, and how porous your hair is. Basically, a baby pink colour will not show up on natural dark hair. It is required that you prelighten, or bleach the hair to a lighter state before putting on the funky colour. The saturation of the colour will then depend on how porous your hair is, meaning, how well the hair absorbs liquid. For example my hair is fine and prelightened to one of the lightest levels possible (without it completely just breaking off) therefore my porosity is quite high. My hair takes the colour quickly, but it never fully absorbs it so colours tend to fade quickly on my hair. Someone with coarser hair who has only prelightened their hair a small bit will half less porous hair and is more likely the colour will last without staining the hair.

The array of colours available are endless, and you could always mix and match to concoct your own desired shade.

Funky dyes come pre-mixed and normally don't need developers. However some salons carry red and orange tones that act as a permanent colour and do require a developer. In drugstores and beauty stores they have different brands and types of colour available. Popular brands for unnatural colours are: Special FX, Manic Panic, Colour Splat! and there are multiple few from high end brand names as well (Paul Mitchell, etc.)

A few things to remember when colouring your hair a funky colour are:
	- A) *Always* wear gloves. Colour stains your hands.
	- B) Use old dirty towels and cover everything and anything that could stain easily.
	- C) Make sure you bought enough of the product to do what you want to do. (Or else you'll look silly running to the store again with half a coloured head.)
	- D) Let the colour sit half an hour. Heat is not needed.
	- E) You can dilute the colours to tone down the brightness using conditioner! Mix little by little to get the desired pastel tone you want. *See Pastel Colours here*
