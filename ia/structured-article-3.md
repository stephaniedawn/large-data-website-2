*Example of a mens cut*

Article:

Mens cuts are one of my favourite things to do. People assume they're easiest because generally they are the quickest to do. Mens cuts are short so they have to be precise and spot on or else you see mistakes.

Right now we're starting to see men with more colour in their hair, hair tattoos and cuts with feminine aspects.

To the right is a good example of a modern mens style. WE have the short cropped sides, and clean around the ear and neckline. But we have that wave of length on top complete with a coloured streak. It's true most men keep their hair cropped whenever possible as it's easier and "more masculine" but there is a rise in edgier styles emerging into the public.

Generally as long as the cut works with your personality and style, is appropriate for work in terms of length and colour, then anything goes!

THe top five mens cuts I do at work would have to be:
- Regular cesar cut. (shaved sides and back with a flick at the front)
- Buzz cut or fade.
- Faux-Hawk.
- Hockey shag.
- Side-part gelled to the side look.

Mens cuts are one of my favourite things to do in the salon! If you have any questions, email me here (with a photo if needed.)
