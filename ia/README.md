# All Things Hair; the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

Hairstyling is a huge part of my life and I live it everyday whether it is at work, at a friends' chatting about the up and coming seasons trends, or working on my personal style for the day at home. We all have hair, we all have a personal style and unfortunately like every part of our body, we sometimes have to deal with a problem or two along the way; whether it's lice, dandruff, or alopecia. I figured I would go more in depth and touch on the not-so-pleasant part of the industry to give people a brief overview of what can happen and what can be avoided when it comes to your hair, scalp and some of the unpleasant conditions that could come up. Of course I'll include the good stuff too, such as funky colours, cool cuts, and trending styles.

## Purpose

This project for Usability class is aimed to teach us how to design larger, more in-depth websites.

I want to learn all that I can to make my website *spiffy.*

This topic is to brush up on the specifics of my hairstyling job, and to educate others on hair and scalp conditions and how you can treat or prevent them.
